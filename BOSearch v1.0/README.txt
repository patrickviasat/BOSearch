**** WARNING ****

Upon first opening the software, windows will automatically assume the executable is a virus. This is because the executable doesn't have a "certificate".
Getting a certificate involves sending the executable to Microsoft and paying to get it validated for no viruses, which is a waste of time and money for an
in-house software. There is, however, a workaround:

- Right click the BOSearch executable
- Select Properties from the drop down
- At the bottom of the "general" screen of the properties, Check the "Unblock" Box
- Hit Apply and Ok
- You should be able to run the software with no issues at this point!

******************

Instructions for use:

1. Run BOSearch
2. The application should automatically pull today's backorder report, which you can see in the "Selected File:" line
   - The application does this by using the pattern which the Backorder reports have been following for this year. It's
     possible that this pattern will change in the future. In this case, you also have the option to manually select
     today's file by hitting the "Browse..." button.
   - Alternatively, if you would like to use a file other than today's backorder report, you can use the "Browse..." 
     button to select that file.
3. Input your job number in the "Enter Job Number:" field.
4. Hit enter or "Get Components"
5. Wait a few moments for the application to scrub the excel sheet.
6. The program will generate a table with the backordered components for your job number!
   - If desired, you can hit "Save as Excel File" to save the table as an excel file.
7. Close out of the table and repeat the procedure with a new job number.
8. Close out of the whole application when finished.

Please let me know if you guys find any bugs!
